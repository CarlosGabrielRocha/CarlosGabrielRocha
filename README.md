My name is Carlos Gabriel, I am 21 years old, and I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.
I am currently studying the Full Stack JavaScript course at OneBitCode.
I enjoy developing new solutions and innovative ideas, and one of my hobbies, which I hope to pursue in the future, is game development. ðŸ™‚
